# ACIFC (Analog Comparator Interface)

## Overview

The Analog Comparator Interface (ACIFC) controls a number of Analog Comparators
(ACs) with identical behavior. Each Analog Comparator compares two voltages and
gives an output depending on this comparison. ACs can be first of all be
configured in the 'normal mode', in which each AC performs a comparison of two
voltages. The other option for comparison is the 'window mode', in which a
voltage can be compared against a window of two voltages.

A specific AC is referred to as ACx, where x is any number from 0 to n, and n is
the index of the last AC module.

## Command

  * ### Command number: `0`

    **Description**: Does the driver exist?

    **Argument 1**: unused

    **Argument 2**: unused

    **Returns**: SUCCESS if it exists, otherwise ENODEVICE

  * ### Command number: `1`

    **Description**: Initialize the ACIFC by enabling the clock, activating the
    ACs (Analog Comparators). Currently in initialization always-on mode is
    enabled, allowing a measurement on an AC to be made quickly after a
    measurement is triggered, without waiting for the AC startup time. The
    drawback is that when the AC is always on the power dissipation will be
    higher.

    **Argument 1**: unused

    **Argument 2**: unused

    **Returns**: SUCCESS if the initialization was succesful


  * ### Command number: `2`

    **Description**: Do a comparison of two inputs, referred to as the positive
    input voltage and the negative input voltage (Vinp and Vinn).

    **Argument 1**: The index of the Analog Comparator for which the comparison
    needs to be made, starting at 0.

    **Argument 2**: unused

    **Returns**: The output of this function is 1 when Vinp > Vinn, and 0 if
    Vinp < Vinn.

  * ### Command number: `3`

    **Description**: Do a comparison of three input voltages. Two ACs, ACx and
    ACx+1 are grouped for this comparison. The sources of the negative input of
    ACx (Vn_x) and the positive input of ACx+1 (Vp_x+1) must be connected
    together externally. These form the common voltage Vcommon. The other two
    remaining sources, being the positive input of ACx (Vp_x) and negative input
    of ACx+1 (Vn_x+1) then define an upper and a lower bound of a window. The
    result then depends on Vcommon lying inside of outside of this window.

    **Argument 1**: The index of the window for which to do a window comparison,
    starting at 0. For example, window 0 is the combination of ACx and ACx+1,
    window 1 is the combination of ACx+2 and ACx+3 etcetera.

    **Argument 2**: unused

    **Returns**: When the voltage of Vcommon lies inside the window defined by
    the positive input of ACx and the negative input of ACx+1, the output will
    be 1; it will be 0 if it is outside of the window. Specifically, the output
    will be 1 when Vn_x+1 < Vcommon < Vp_x, and 0 if Vcommon < Vn_x+1 or Vcommon
    > Vp_x.
